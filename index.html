                <p>Down the street you can hear her scream</p>
                <p>"You're a disgrace"</p>
                <p>As she slams the door in his drunken face</p>
                <p>And now he stands outside</p>
                <p>And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool</p>
                <p>He cries "oh girl, you must be mad</p>
                <p>What happened to the seet love you and me had"</p>
                <p>Against the door he leans and starts a scene</p>
                <p>And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
                <p>And so castles made of sand,</p>
                <p>Fall in the sea eventually</p>
                <p>A little indian brave who before he was ten</p>
                <p>Played war games in the woods with his indian friends</p>
                <p>And he built a dream that when he grew up</p>
                <p>He would be a fearless warrior indian chief</p>
                <p>Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow</p>
                <p>He would sing his first war song</p>
                <p>And fight his first battle but something went wrong</p>
                <p>Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night</p>
                <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
                <p>Melts into the sea eventually</p>
                <p>There was a young girl whose heart was a frown</p>
                <p>Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound</p>
                <p>And she wished and prayed she would stop living</p>
                <p>So she decided to die</p>
                <p>She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore</p>
                <p>And to her legs she smiled</p>
                <p>"You won't hurt me no more"</p>
                <p>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</p>
                <p>"Look a golden winged ship is passing my way"</p>
                <p>And it really didn't have to stop</p>
                <p>It just kept on going</p>
                <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
                <p>Slips into the sea eventually</p>
